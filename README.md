# Random-Password-Generator

This webpage will allow the user to generate a random, secure password that contains at least 8 and no more than 128 characters. When the user clicks on generate password button, the user will be asked questions to decide whether or not the password should contain lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters. User must choose at least one character type to generate a password. 

## Description

This webpage uses HTML, CSS, but mainly Javascript to be able to generate passwords. The use of arrays, loops, and if statements from Javascript allows the computer to follow simple steps in generating an all random password. 

Once loaded into the webpage, the user is able to click on the Generate Password button in order to begin. It will prompt the user to choose a length for the password that is between 8-128. It will also ask the user if they would like certain character types in the password, which are lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters. Once all questions have been answered, and at least one character type selected, the random generated password will show up in the text box ready to be used. 

## Future Features

Generated passwords will be able to be kept in the local storage along with the website name and/or link that the password was generated for. This will allow the user to easily access these passwords.
